# G4 Benchmark Datasets for Intracellular G4 Sequencing Data

This repository contains benchmark datasets of intracellular G-quadruplex (G4) sequencing data. Each benchmark dataset corresponds to a GEO dataset, identified by their accession numbers. These GEO datasets were generated through antibody-dependent experiments under varying conditions, using either the BG4 or G4P antibody, and employing either ChIP-Seq or CUT&Tag techniques. The data originated from either the HEK293T or K562 cell lines.

## Overview

The benchmark datasets were generated by the following process:

1. **Peak Calling and Ranking**:  
   Multiple peak-calling algorithms were applied to each dataset. For each algorithm, the identified peaks were ranked based on their p-values or corresponding significance scores.

2. **Selection of Top Peaks**:  
   For each algorithm, the top 100, top 1,000, top 10,000, and top 100,000 G4 peaks were selected (ranked by p-values or significance scores).

3. **Merging Top Peaks**:  
   The top 100, top 1,000, top 10,000 and top 100,000 peaks from various peak-calling algorithms were merged into distinct files repectively, based on the integrating criteria:
   - `Top_merge_100_merge.bed` (Top 100 peaks)
   - `Top_merge_1000_merge.bed` (Top 1,000 peaks)
   - `Top_merge_10000_merge.bed` (Top 10,000 peaks)
   - `Top_merge_100000_merge.bed` (Top 100,000 peaks)

   **The Integrating Criteria for Benchmark**:  
   A peak was included in the  benchmark if it was identified by more than half of the peak-calling algorithms applied to the dataset.

## Data Processing

- **GSE107690 and GSE145090**: These two datasets are single-ended sequencing datasets and were processed using five peak-calling algorithms: MACS2, HOMER, SICER, PeakRanger, and GEM. The resulting benchmark datasets consist of G4 peaks identified by at least two of the five algorithms.

- **GSE133379**: This dataset was processed using six peak-calling algorithms: MACS2, HOMER, SICER, PeakRanger, GEM, and GoPeaks. The resulting benchmark datasets consist of G4 peaks identified by at least three of the six algorithms.

- **Other datasets**: These datasets were processed using seven peak-calling algorithms: MACS2, HOMER, SICER, PeakRanger, GEM, GoPeaks, and SEACR. The resulting benchmark datasets consist of G4 peaks identified by at least three of the five algorithms.

## Purpose

This project aims to facilitate the comparison and evaluation of peak-calling algorithms for G4 sequencing data. It provides a valuable resource for researchers working on intracellular G4 data processing.

By integrating results from various algorithms, these benchmark datasets can serve as robust references for assessing  the performance and reliability of G4 peak-calling methods.
